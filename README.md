Learning to use ML for computer vision.  I am following the instructions in
[Deep Learning with python, by Francois Chollet](https://tanthiamhuat.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/deeplearningwithpython.pdf)

## Installation

Dependencies are listed in requirements.txt.  Note the OSX-specific versions
of tensorflow, you will need to change these for other machines.
Since the ML modules can be hefty, it's recommended to create a virtual
environment.

```shell
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
